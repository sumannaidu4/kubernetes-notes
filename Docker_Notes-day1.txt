Docker Is a containerization software using which we can create containers.

Docker is for Devlepors, Admins(DevOps) to build and run applications as contianers.

Docker Editions:

Docker CE --> Comunity Edition --> Open Source(Free)

Docker EE --> Enterprise Edition --> Commercial

Type: Containerization
Vendor: Docker INC

O.S --> Cross Platform(Docker can be installed in any O.S)

Docker Can Be Installed in Linux, Windows OS ,mac OS  

Docker CE Can be installed in Most of the linux except redhat.

Docker EE can installed in all O.S including redhat.

Docker CE --> OpenSouce Free

Docker EE --> Commerical
   DTR --> Docker Trusted Registry(Private Repo to main docker images)
   UCP --> Universal Controll Pane --> It's GUI for managing Docker Machines

Docker,CoreOS,Rockert --> Containerzation Platforms/Softwares.



Dockerfile --> Dockerfile is file which contains instructions to create an image. Which contains 
               Docker Domain Specific Key Words to build image.
			
		   
DockerImage --> It's a package which contains everything(Softwares+ENV+Application Code) to run your application.

DockerContainer --> Run time instance of an image.If you run docker image container will be created
                    that's where our application(process) is running.
DockerRegistriy/Repository

DockerRepo/Registry. --> We can store and share the docker images.

Public Repo --> Docker hub is a public reposotiry. Which contains all the open source softwares as 
a docker images. We can think of docker hub as play store for docker images.


Private Repo(Nexus,JFrog,D.T.R(Docker Trusted Registory)),AWS ECR  --> We can store and share the docker images with in our company
network using private repo

Docker Enigine/Daemon/Host --> It's a software or program using which we can create images & contianers.

Docker is cross platform.

Docker CE
   Docker CE will not be supported by Redhat.
   
 
Docker EE
  Docker EE will be support most of the os including redhat.

What is docker hub?
It's a public repository for docker images. You can think as play store for
docker images.

Install Docker on AWS Ubuntu
############################
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo service docker start

sudo docker info

# Check docker is installed or not
   docker info

# You will get permison denied error as regular user dosn't have permisions to execute docker commands.Add user to docker group.

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 
     or 
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Exit From Current SSH Terminal & SSH(Login) again .Then execute 
docker ps


# Amazon Linux
================
sudo yum update -y		
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start

Add Regural user to dockergroup
sudo usermod -aG docker  <username>

ex:
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

Once you add user to group exit from the server and login again.
# Get docker information
docker info

#Install Docker in Linux (Works for most of linux flavors).
sudo curl -fsSL get.docker.com | /bin/bash


Docker Home/Working Dir: 
/var/lib/docker


Install Docker on AWS RHEL  (Offcially No Support)
############################
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo dnf install docker-ce-3:18.09.1-3.el7 -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker


sudo docker info

# Check docker is installed or not
docker info

# You will get permison denied error as regular user dosn't have permisions to execute docker commands.Add user to docker group.

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 
or 
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

# Exit From Current SSH Terminal & SSH(Login) again .Then execute 
docker ps




How many containers we can run in on system/server?
It dependes on your system resources(CPU,RAM).
